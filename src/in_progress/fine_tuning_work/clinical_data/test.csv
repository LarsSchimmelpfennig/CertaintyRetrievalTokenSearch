The patient presents with concerns of dyspnea, primarily manifesting during asthma attacks. They report notable nasal symptoms, such as congestion and occasional rhinorrhea, but do not have a cough, fever, or respiratory pain. The patient's asthma appears to be self-managed with inhaled bronchodilators, and they are not on a regular corticosteroid regimen. Despite the absence of respiratory pain, the patient is increasingly distressed by the intermittent shortness of breath which disrupts daily activities and sleep patterns. There have been no recent changes or additions to their daily medications, and their asthma action plan was last reviewed approximately one year ago.
