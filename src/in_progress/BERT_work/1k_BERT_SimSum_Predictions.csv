Patient reports experiencing respiratory pain described as scraping in the trachea that began approximately three days ago. The pain is associated with a productive cough, with observable phlegm, particularly worse in the morning. Patient also reports significant dyspnea, describing a distinct difficulty in drawing breath, especially when engaging in even mild physical activities. These symptoms have noticeably exacerbated their pre-existing asthma condition, notwithstanding their consistent use of a prescribed inhaler, which offers minimal relief currently. Patient denies any other changes in medications or recent exposure to known irritants.

Upon examination, patient appears to be in mild respiratory distress. Respiratory rate is elevated at 22 breaths per minute, with an audible wheeze upon both inspiratory and expiratory phases. Trachea is midline with no palpable abnormalities. Auscultation of the lung fields revealed bilateral wheezing throughout with decreased breath sounds at the bases. Use of accessory muscles noted during respiration. No cyanosis or clubbing observed.

The patient presents with concerns of dyspnea, primarily manifesting during asthma attacks. They report notable nasal symptoms, such as congestion and occasional rhinorrhea, but do not have a cough, fever, or respiratory pain. The patient's asthma appears to be self-managed with inhaled bronchodilators, and they are not on a regular corticosteroid regimen. Despite the absence of respiratory pain, the patient is increasingly distressed by the intermittent shortness of breath which disrupts daily activities and sleep patterns. There have been no recent changes or additions to their daily medications, and their asthma action plan was last reviewed approximately one year ago. There is no known recent exposure to respiratory irritants or allergens in the home environment.

The patient states they have a history of asthma but mentions that their condition typically is well-managed with maintenance inhalers. However, this episode seems more challenging to control through usual medications. Flare-ups of nasal symptoms during allergy season are commonly experienced but usually do not escalate to such severe dyspnea.
